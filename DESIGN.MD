# mob story
Concept by Robert Phares ([rjphares](https://github.com/rjphares))

* Titus the Fox
* The main character is edward
* Main character is ex-mob
* His wife/gf/friend/someone_he_likes gets kidnapped by the mob and he has to rescue her
* So we can do like a scene of her getting kidnapped like donkey kong
* Maybe shes on vacation?
* Preferably somewhere international
* They are human trafficers
* So each level can levels of mob bad guys he has to kill
* First level he is in the street and kind of has to escape street goons
* Maybe has to do w/ a girl
* Easy game to beat
* Like a graphic novel
* Defintely want a gear level
  - gears as objects that cant go through
  - he can touch one gear at a time (should move him)
  - he sits inside one gear and it will push him to other side
  - if both gears squish him he dies
  - sneak through or get squished(dead)
* Maybe an abandoned factory or something
* Add water level
* Up down platformer
* Escort robot (level) to sync clocks on systems and open door(s)
* Pretty simple so we can change stuff easily
