Concept by Robert Phares ([rjphares](https://github.com/rjphares))

* Titus the Fox
* Main character is ex-mob
* First level he is in the street and kind of has to escape street goons
* Maybe has to do w/ a girl
* Easy game to beat
* Like a graphic novel
* Defintely want a gear level
  - gears as objects that cant go through
  - he can touch one gear at a time
  - if both gears squish him he dies
  - sneak through or get squished(dead)
* Maybe an abandoned factory or something
* Add water level
* Up down platformer
